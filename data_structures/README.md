# Data Structure

There are many memory management issuses in the code, such as not using `::operator new()`.

This project is mainly intended to demonstrate the structure of data structures, so the code has been simplified for better readability and understanding.

> Exception: The `DynamicArray` class tries to follow the standard implementation as closely as possible, so its code is relatively more extensive.
