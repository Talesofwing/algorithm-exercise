Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm, primarily used for educational purposes to illustrate the basic concepts of sorting. While easy to understand and implement, it's not very efficient with $O(n^2)$ time complexity and is rarely used in practical applications due to the availability of more efficient algorithms. The process is as follows:

1. Compare two adjacent elements, and swap them if they meet the condition
2. Compare all adjacent elements from start to end
3. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated within a loop that runs at most $n - 1$ times, where $n$ is the length of the array

The core idea is to repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them to gradually move the larger(or smaller) elements to the end of the sequence.
