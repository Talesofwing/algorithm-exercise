# Bubble-Sort

> - Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
> - Space Complexity: $O(1)$

Bubble sort is a very simple sorting algorithm, but it is not very efficient. It is often used in problems that require sorting in ascending or descending order. The process is as follows:

1. Compare two adjacent elements, and swap them if they meet the condition
2. Judge all adjacent elements from start to end
3. Steps 1 and 2 are executed n times

The core idea is to repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them to gradually move the larger(or smaller) elements to the end of the sequence.
