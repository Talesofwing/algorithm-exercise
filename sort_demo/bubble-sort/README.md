Bubble sort is a very simple sorting algorithm, but it is not very efficient. It is often used in problems that require sorting in ascending or descending order and is considered a classic algorithm. The process is as follows:

1. Compare two adjacent elements, and swap them if they meet the condition
2. Judge all adjacent elements from start to end
3. Steps 1 and 2 are executed n times
