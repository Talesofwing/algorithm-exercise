# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming(DP) is primarily used to solve problems that exhibit overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. It works by breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

The challenge in DP lies in how to decompose the problem into subproblems.
