Parity can be used as the main criterion for judgment.

First, when the total difference is an odd number, the required number of steps should also be odd to perfectly utilize all steps. Similarly, when the total difference is an even number, the number of steps should also be even.

Based on this, the first step is to determine whether the total difference and the given number of steps $k$ have the same parity. Additionally, it must be checked whether the total difference is less than or equal to $k$ to ensure that all necessary changes can be completed within $k$ steps.
