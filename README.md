# Algorithm & Data Structure

Algorithms play a crucial role in the field of programming, especially in the development of large projects where performance and memory requirements are extremely stringent. Mastering excellent programming skills and possessing a deep understanding of `potimization` thinking are essential for the development of such projects, as they can provide significant assistance in many aspects.

Moreover, another core element closely intertwined with algorithms is data structures. Data structures involve the methods of storing and processing data, including classic structures such as `Stack` and `Queue`. Data structures provide the foundation for algorithms, while algorithms represent the effective utilization and application of data structures. The two are interdependent and together form the essence of program design.

Taking the [Breadth-First Search（BFS）](bfs_demos/README.md) algorithm as an example, it is based on the First In, FIrst Out(FIFO) principle of data structures - typically a `queue` - to execute its search process. This approach efficiently traverses graphs or tree structures, demonstrating the critical role of data structures in algorithm design.
